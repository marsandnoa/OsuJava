## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of Java projects and homework assignments. The primary goal is to progressively work on assignments that lead to the development of a mini compiler for the Bug language in the second half of the class.

Each project builds upon the previous one.

In addition to projects, this repository contains various homework assignments related to topics such as lexing, parsing algorithms, symbol tables, and more. These assignments are designed to reinforce theoretical knowledge and practical skills in compiler construction.

## Mini Compiler

The final culmination of the projects and homeworks is the creation of a mini compiler for the Bug language. The mini compiler is a simplified version, demonstrating the application of all the compiler components learned throughout the second part of the course.
